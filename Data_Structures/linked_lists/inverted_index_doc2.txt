Detail of Akbar's mausoleum
Emperor Akbar ascended the Mughal throne at the age of 14. During his reign he enlarged
 his kingdom of Northern India, Afghanistan and Persia, and although he was a Muslim he had 
 Hindus in his government.

Akbar had three hundred wives including some who were Hindus. He was known for his princely 
manners and he loved literature and art, and encouraged both. In fact he was illiterate, but he
enjoyed serious discussion. He also had many fine buildings built. He was known for the 
firmness and wisdom of his rule and was given the title 'Guardian of Mankind'. He died shortly
before he was to meet an Englishman for the first time, sent by James I and VI. He was 
succeeded by his son, Jahangir.
